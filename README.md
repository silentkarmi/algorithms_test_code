|---- HeadTailToss :  Numerical validation of Coin Toss Probability (50%-50%)
Mathematical experiment, to know the probability of coin tosses. Result -> As the number of experiments are increased, the more it reaches the assumed 50 - 50 percent of head and tails. By induction it seems, if we keep on experimenting with large numbers and to infinity, the result will be actually 50 - 50. That's how a in order random event, can be quantified if a large set of the data is taken.Here are the results of the experiment:
  
Coin Toss 10 times		= 70% Head / 30% Tail,
Coin Toss 100 times		= 45 / 55,
Coin Toss 1000 times, 		= 51.3 / 48.7,
Coin Toss 10000 times, 		= 50.16 / 49.84,
Coin Toss 1 Lakh times, 	= 50.205 / 49.84,
Coin Toss 1 Crore times, 	= 49.979 / 50.021,
Coin Toss 10 Crore times, 	= 49.9946 / 50.0054

if, a probability shows that it has a 50-50 percent chance of occuring and it doesn't occur then, the game is probably rigged.
